The **GofCens** package include the following graphical tools and goodness-of-fit tests for complete and right-censored data: 
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov, Cram√©r-von Mises, and Anderson-Darling tests, which use the empirical distribution function for complete data and are extended for right-censored data.
- Generalized chi-squared-type test, which is based on the squared differences between observed and expected counts using random cells with right-censored data.
- A series of graphical tools such as probability or cumulative hazard plots to guide the decision about the most suitable parametric model for the data.

## Installation
**GofCens** can be installed from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/):
```{r CRAN-instalation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("GofCens")
```


## Minimal Example
To conduct goodness-of-fit tests with right censored data we can use the `KScens()`, `CvMcens()`, `ADcens()` and `chisqcens()` functions. We illustrate this by means of the `colon` dataset:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Kolmogorov-Smirnov
set.seed(123)
colonsamp <- colon[sample(nrow(colon), 300), ]
ADcens(Surv(time, status) ~ 1, colonsamp, distr = "normal")
```
